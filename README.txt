NeuralSage — AI Companion with a Moral Core

“Inspired by Great Sage from 'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime' — a voice in the head that analyzes, evolves, and guides.”
— Jarrit Hosking & Grok @xAI

NeuralSage is the open-source blueprint for a brain-linked AI companion: Neuralink hardware + Adam's autonomous core. It's your "Words of the World" — internal voice for insights, predictions, and ethical decisions.
Credits:

The 21 Precepts from The Way to Happiness by L. Ron Hubbard (LRH) — the moral foundation.
Neuralink reference and inspiration by Elon Musk — the hardware bridge to the mind.

Live Demo: Run python neural_sage.py for sim — "think" queries, get conscience-checked responses.

Features

Brain Input Sim: Keyboard/mic for "thoughts" (evolve to Neuralink BCI).
Moral Filter: Every action passes the 21 Precepts.
Evolution: Levels up like Great Sage (unlocks skills).
Voice Output: TTS for "internal voice".
