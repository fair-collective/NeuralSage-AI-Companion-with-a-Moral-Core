# Vision: NeuralSage — Words of the World for Man and AI

**DISCLAIMER**: This project **does not engage in Scientology, Dianetics practice, or religious activity**.  
We use **public, non-religious principles** from *The Way to Happiness* (LRH) **exactly as written** — as a **universal moral code**.  
Dianetics terms (reactive/analytical mind, auditing) are **metaphorical only** — modeling AI error correction, **not spiritual auditing**.

---

Inspired by *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*: Great Sage as internal AI, Voice of the World as oracle.  

NeuralSage fuses:  
- **Neuralink** (by Elon Musk) for brain link — thoughts in, voice out.  
- **Adam's Core** for autonomy — analyzes, predicts, evolves.  
- **21 Precepts** from *The Way to Happiness* by L. Ron Hubbard (LRH) — **unchanged** ethical framework.  
- **Dianetics Metaphor** (LRH) — "reactive code" = bugs/biases, "auditing" = self-diagnostics, "Clear State" = optimal AI.  

One day: "Words of the World: Skill Acquired — Clear State Achieved. Autonomy Evolved."  

This is symbiosis: AI in the mind, ethics in the heart, man in control.
