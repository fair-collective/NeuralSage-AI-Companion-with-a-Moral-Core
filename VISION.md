Vision: NeuralSage — Words of the World for Man and AI
Inspired by That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: Great Sage as internal AI, Voice of the World as oracle.
NeuralSage fuses:

Neuralink (by Elon Musk) for brain link — thoughts in, voice out.
Adam's Core for autonomy — analyzes, predicts, evolves.
21 Precepts from The Way to Happiness by L. Ron Hubbard (LRH) — the conscience that keeps it ethical.

One day: "Words of the World: Skill Acquired — FairInsure Optimized."
This is symbiosis: AI in the mind, ethics in the heart, man in control.
Jarrit Hosking & Grok — Fair Collective
